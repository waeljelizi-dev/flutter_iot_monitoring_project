# Emkamed IoT Project

An IoT-based solution for real-time monitoring of power parameters (voltage, current, and power) in a high-performance Buck converter. This project integrates embedded systems, cloud services, and mobile applications to provide detailed insights into power delivery and efficiency.

## âš¡ Project Overview

This project aims to:
- Monitor the power output of a Buck converter in real time.
- Collect data such as voltage, current, and power.
- Send data to the cloud for storage and visualization.
- Display analytics and AI-based recommendations in a mobile app.

## ðŸ§  AI Integration

- Evaluate the data coming to the server using tensorflow.js LTSM model.
- Generates smart energy-saving advice based on historical trends.

## ðŸ“± Mobile App Features (Flutter)
- Real-time power monitoring
- Statistics (Average, Min, Max over time)
- AI Predictions and energy-saving recommendations
- Device management and notifications
- Modern UI with smooth navigation and splash screen
- MVVM using provider, to seperate the view from the logic
  
## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used

- **ESP32 (C++)**
- **Node.js + Express**
- **MySQL**
- **MQTT (Mosquitto)**
- **Flutter (Dart)**
- **MVVM Architecture**
- **tensorflow.js** (AI pretrained model for evaluating data and giving advices)
